# High Low Game

Built a game using the CLI: 

- game picks a random number between 1 and 100
- propmts user to guess the number
- if users guess is less than the number, it ouputs "HIGHER"
- if users guess is more than the number, it outputs "LOWER"
- if user guesses the number, the game should declare "GOOD GUESS!"


####Game declares "GOOD GUESS! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!! Rock on.!" -- when number is guessed correctly.
